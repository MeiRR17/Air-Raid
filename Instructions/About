Game Mechanics:

The game has 2 players who control planes that automatically fly.
The players can only launch bombs to destroy objects on the canyon.
The objects are placed in specific locations: 4 points, 3 points, 2 points and 1 point, can be placed according to their rarity.
Each player can only launch one bomb at a time.
Once an object is destroyed, it does not reappear.
If a player hits the canyon 4 times, they lose the game.

Winning and Losing:

The player who destroys the most objects without hitting the canyon wins the game.
If both players have the same number of destroyed objects, the game is a tie.
