The Player class has a fly method that creates a new Thread object but doesn't start it.
 The run method of the Thread object is not overridden, so nothing happens when the thread is started.
 It seems that the fly method is supposed to be the run method of the Player object, but it has the wrong signature.

The Gameplay class initializes the Bomb object to null and never sets it to a non-null value.
Therefore, the bomb is never painted on the screen, even though there is code in the paintComponent method to do so.

The Gameplay class has a boolean variable isRunning that is never used.
It seems that this variable is supposed to control the game loop, but there is no game loop implemented.

The Player class has a moveRight method, but there are no corresponding methods to move the player up,
down, or left. The fly method seems to be an attempt to make the player move automatically, but it doesn't work as intended.

The Player class has a paint method that paints the player using the Graphics.fillRect method,
but there is no corresponding method to erase the player's previous position. Therefore, the player leaves a trail on
the screen when it moves.

The Player class has a getWidth method that returns the player's width, but there is no corresponding method to get the player's height.

The Bomb class has a syntax error in the constructor's parameter list. The ... should be replaced with a variable name.

The Bomb class has a draw method that is never called. The paintComponent method of the Gameplay
class should call the draw method to paint the bomb on the screen.

The Gameplay class registers itself as a key listener, but it doesn't implement any of the KeyListener methods.
Therefore, it doesn't respond to keyboard events.
