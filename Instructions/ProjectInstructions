1. Create a game window and set up the graphics environment.

2. Create a Player class that represents each player's plane.
The plane should move automatically, and the player should be able to launch bombs by pressing a key.

3. Create an Object class that represents the objects that need to be destroyed. Each object should have a different point value.

4. Place the objects on the screen in specific locations.

5. Create a Bomb class that represents the bombs that players launch.
The bombs should move automatically and destroy any objects they come into contact with.

6. Implement collision detection between the bombs and the objects, and between the players and the canyon.
If a player hits the canyon too many times, they lose the game.

7. Keep track of each player's score, and end the game when a certain number of objects
have been destroyed or when one of the players hits the canyon too many times.

8. Add sound effects and other features to enhance the game's playability.
